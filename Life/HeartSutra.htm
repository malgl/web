觀自在菩薩 行心般若波羅密多時 照見五蘊皆空 度一切苦厄
<br>Avalokiteshvara while practicing deeply with the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore, suddenly discovered that all of the five Skandhas are equally empty, and with this realization he overcame all Ill-being.
<br>
<br>舍利子 色不異空 空不異色 色卽是空 空卽是色 受想行識 亦復如是
<br>Listen Sariputra, this Body itself is Emptiness and Emptiness itself is this Body. This Body is not other than Emptiness and Emptiness is not other than this Body. The same is true of Feelings, Perceptions, Mental Formations, and Consciousness.
<br>
<br>舍利子 是諸法空相 不生不滅 不垢不淨 不增不減
<br>Listen Sariputra, all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness; their true nature is the nature of no Birth no Death, no Being no Non-being, no Defilement no Purity, no Increasing no Decreasing.
<br>
<br>是故 空中無色 無受想行識 無眼耳鼻舌身意 無色聲香味觸法 無眼界 乃至 無意識界
<br>That is why in Emptiness, Body, Feelings, Perceptions, Mental Formations and Consciousness are not separate self entities. The Eighteen Realms of Phenomena which are the six Sense Organs, the six Sense Objects, and the six Consciousnesses are also not separate self entities.
<br>
<br>無無明 亦無無明盡 乃至 無老死 亦無老死盡 無苦集滅道 無智亦無得 以無所得故
<br>The Twelve Links of Interdependent Arising and their Extinction are also not separate self entities. Ill-being, the Causes of Ill-being, the End of Ill-being, the Path, insight and attainment, are also not separate self entities. Whoever can see this no longer needs anything to attain.
<br>
<br>菩提薩埵 依般若波羅密多故 心無罣礙 無罣礙故 無有恐怖 遠離顚倒夢想 究竟涅槃
<br>Bodhisattvas who practice the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore see no more obstacles in their mind, and because there are no more obstacles in their mind, they can overcome all fear, destroy all wrong perceptions and realize Perfect Nirvana.
<br>
<br>三世諸佛 依般若波羅密多故 得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提
<br>All Buddhas in the past, present and future by practicing the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore are all capable of attaining Authentic and Perfect Enlightenment.
<br>
<br>故知 般若波羅密多 是大神呪 是大明呪 是無上呪 是無等等呪 能除一切苦 眞實不虛
<br>Therefore Sariputra, it should be known that the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore is a Great Mantra, the most illuminating mantra, the highest mantra, a mantra beyond compare, the True Wisdom that has the power to put an end to all kinds of suffering.
<br>
<br>故說 般若波羅密多呪 卽說呪曰 揭諦 揭諦 波羅揭諦 波羅僧揭諦 菩提 娑婆訶
<br>Therefore let us proclaim a mantra to praise the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore. Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!
